# Malcolm Portfolio Website

A stylish single-page portfolio layout built with React and Tailwind CSS using Vite. The structure highlights key
sections for a creative professional, including hero, about, projects, and contact areas.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Libraries used:

I used a Vanta.js cloud effect for the front page, and I tweaked it to match the style of my website - https://www.vantajs.com/?effect=clouds
